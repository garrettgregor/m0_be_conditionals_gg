# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    1. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being most confident, I'd say I feel about about a 6.5 - sometimes I still forget to put `==` and just use `=` when trying to see whether something is equal to another. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    1. For logical operators, I'd say I'm probable around an 9 - although I found myself needing to remind myself what the logical operator was for `or` whereas I could easily recall `&&` and `and`; (the `||` is the one for `or` statements.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    1. With `if` statements, I find myself at about a 7; sometimes I forget to include `""` for a string and don't immediately jump to the proper syntax when it comes to writing if/else, and I wish I had more time to go back to the practice challenge in the conditionals lesson and to do the spicy challenge.  
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    1. To the point I made above, with my day not going to plan yesterday, I found myself a little stressed with not being where I wanted to be. The conditionals assignment took me about an hour longer than I anticipated and I think it will be prudent to revise my calendar to allow for more time on assignments in the future.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    1. As I said above, I'd still like to go back to the spicy challenge, and to the practice challenge. I will put an additional 30mins for each on my calendar.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    1. The questions I have is around how common it is to remeber all of these operators - it seems like there are just so many operators to remember, and I'm wondering if as a professional developer it's common to have to look them up and what is common to just be able to pull from memory. I'd like to ask this question in class, but I can also I'm sure find examples and stories from [reddit](reddit.com) or [stackexchange](stackexchange.com).
